						<h2>MMTrip</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The motivation behind MMTrip stems from the increasing complexity of urban transportation systems and the growing demand for efficient and integrated mobility solutions. With the expansion of urbanization, there has been a rise in the variety of transportation modes available, ranging from public transport to ride-sharing services and cycling options. However, this diversity also complicates the process of trip planning, requiring individuals to navigate through multiple options and considerations to find the optimal route.
					</p>
					<p>MMTrip aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for multi-modal trip planning. By integrating various modes of transportation, including flights, public transport, driving, walking, and biking, MMTrip offers users a holistic view of their travel options. The ability to personalize trips based on preferences such as time, cost, and comfort, as well as constraints like maximum walking distance, further enhances the user experience.
					</p>
					<p>Additionally, MMTrip leverages machine learning-powered algorithms for accurate prediction of trip costs and real-time updates on route availability. This not only simplifies the trip planning process but also ensures that users are equipped with the most up-to-date information for their journey.
					</p>
					<p>In summary, MMTrip is motivated by the need for a comprehensive, integrated, and user-centric approach to trip planning in urban environments. By offering a seamless and personalized experience, MMTrip aims to make multi-modal travel more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for users.
