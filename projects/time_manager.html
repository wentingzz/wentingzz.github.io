					<p>The Time Manager App is designed to optimize your daily schedule by predicting the time required to complete various tasks and fitting them into your calendar. Leveraging machine learning, this app processes data from three key files—Tasks_Training.xlsx, Events_test.txt, and Tasks_test.xlsx—to train a model that accurately estimates task durations and schedules them efficiently. Additionally, the app seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar to automatically create events for your tasks.

					<p>In this demo, the app aims to efficiently manage tasks and events within a user's schedule. On the left side of the screen, users can view their input files, which include existing events and tasks to complete. On the right side, the app dynamically organizes these tasks to fit into the user's preferred working hours while respecting specified deadlines and avoiding conflicts with existing events. If certain tasks cannot be accommodated within the preferred working hours, the app notifies the user with a warning message advising them to use their leisure time for these tasks.</p>
					<p>
					The app also integrates with Google Calendar, allowing users to see the scheduled tasks added to their calendar. Users can choose to hide these tasks by unselecting the "Time Manager Suggested" calendar. Additionally, by connecting their Google Calendar to the app, users can enable automatic creation of events for the scheduled tasks, ensuring that only tasks that fit into their preferred working time are added to the calendar.</p>
