						<h2>Genshin Impact Planner</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The motivation behind developing this app was to address the challenge of efficiently managing and tracking the upgrade progress of multiple characters and weapons simultaneously in Genshin Impact. With the game's complex upgrade system requiring different materials and priorities for each character and weapon, it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything manually. This app simplifies the process by automating the calculation of required materials, displaying availability based on the day of the week, and providing a prioritization system for efficient resource allocation. Additionally, it seeks to automate repeated tasks, further enhancing the convenience and efficiency of managing upgrades. It aims to enhance the gaming experience by offering a convenient tool for players to plan and optimize their upgrade strategies, ultimately saving time and enhancing overall gameplay enjoyment.

						Users can input character names into the sheet, with the needed materials automatically populated on the right in grey text (as this detail is less important for user interaction). Users only need to focus on entering data in the columns highlighted in black. They can then specify the priority as H/M/L, which will be reflected in the weekly summary, or leave it blank for future planning. The process for managing weapons is identical to managing characters.
					</p>
					<p>
						Users can also add new characters. In the demo, we add a new character called "Test" with needed materials. When we go back to Resource Planner, the information is populated correctly if we enter "Test" and we can do the same just like we did for other characters.
